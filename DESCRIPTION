Package: BaalChIP
Title: BaalChIP: Bayesian Analysis of Allelic imbalances from ChIP-seq data of cancer genomes correcting for allele copy-number frequency
Description: The package offers functions to process multiple ChIP-seq BAM files and detect allele-specific events. Computes allele counts at individual variants (SNPs/SNVs), implements extensive QC steps to remove problematic variants, and utilizes a bayesian framework to identify statistically significant allele-specific events. The bayesian framework is able to account for copy number differences between the two alleles, a known phenotypical feature of cancer samples.

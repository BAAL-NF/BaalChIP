Computes allele counts at individual variants (SNPs/SNVs), implements extensive QC steps to remove problematic variants, and utilizes a bayesian framework to identify statistically significant allele-specific events. The bayesian framework is able to account for copy number differences between the two alleles, a known phenotypical feature of cancer samples. \nDepends: R (>= 3.1.2), GenomicRanges, Rsamtools, GenomicAlignments\nImports: ggplot2, reshape2, doBy, coda, foreach, doParallel, GenomeInfoDb\nLicense: Artistic-2.0\nLazyData: true\n",
